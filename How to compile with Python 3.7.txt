1. Since Python 3.7 is the last version fully compatible with Windows 7. We need to download and install it.

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/

2. Go to installed directory and make the environment in Python 3.7

cd C:\Users\u\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37
python -m venv py37env

Note : We need to make the Environment only once, but before using it we need to activate this environment everytime.

3. Activate the Environmant

py37env\Scripts\activate

4. Install necessary Python library for our program
pip install auto-py-to-exe

5. Run the program to compile Python to .exe
auto-py-to-exe

6. After the program run, select the option "One File" and "Window Based (hide the console)"

Also set the location of output .exe file in "Settings > Output Directory"
